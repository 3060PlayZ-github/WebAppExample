# WebAppExample

# What is this?
This is an example of how to make an WebApp.

# What is an Web app?
Well, remember that popup that let's you install an site like an app. That's basically it!

#  FAQ:
- I tried running the HTML file and the install app as site button didn't work. Why?
  You need to host the files somewhere and not run it directly.
- How can I use it on Android?
  Go to the 3 dots, select Install as app or Add to desktop (on older Chrome versions.)
